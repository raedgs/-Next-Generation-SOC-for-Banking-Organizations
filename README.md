# -Next-Generation-SOC-for-Banking-Organizations
The main purpose of this project is to implement a Proof of Concept (PoC) of a next generation
SOC solution provided by ITC while considering the requirements expressed in the current project
specification sheet. In particular, the goal of this project is to design a functional and technical
architecture, benchmarking opensource solutions, installing and testing the solutions chosen to integrate
them in the same environment.
The following features have to be considered in the deployed SOC:
• Vulnerability Management: Correlating log data with threat intelligence to understand what
exploits attackers are using, and identify vulnerable elements within an infrastructure before they
can be compromised.
• Automated Incident Response: Taking action automatically when a particular kind of incident
occurs via sets of rules called playbooks. Via this functionality, it is possible to set up automated
responses for the most common incident types.
• Investigations Coordination: Organizing security data easily and retrieving relevant third-party
threat intelligence when being needed. Instant access to external data sources helps analysts make
the right decision in every investigation.
• Automate compliance reporting: the provided solution should achieve compliance with
applicable industry regulations such as ISO2700x, GDPR, HIPAA, SWIFT, SOX, and PCI DSS.
• Comprehensive Integration: Getting different IT security solutions to work together because
SOCs often use a range of security tools from various vendors, which even though they are
practical on their own, these tools lack interoperability.
• Security analytics integration: to properly ingest and analyze data, machine learning and deep
learning technologies have to be considered. The deployed ML/DL-based security solutions should
detect abnormal and risky behavior on the corporate network (e.g., prevent the misuse of privileged
account access, ensure the appropriate use of access rights, verify files integrity, and prevent data loss
and data leakage).
• Automate Asset Security Testing: offensive security should also be supported through the
automation of: the monitoring and analysis of threats and misconfiguration of assets, provide real-time
scanning, and provide summarized and detailed PDF reports.
Secure the bank’s IT infrastructure through the deployment of appropriate opensource tools to
manage and monitor data, files, servers, network equipment and virtual machines.
• Control traffic, prevent unwanted traffic, and validate network access.
• Monitor file integrity to detect changes to files and directories.
• Record and monitor endpoints and network traffic, create analytics, alert the security team of
suspicious behavior and stop the cyber incident.
